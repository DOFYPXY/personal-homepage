I am a first year Ph.D. student at computer science in [University of Wisconsin - Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/)。I am fortunate to work with [Prof. Loris D'Antoni](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~loris/). My main research interest is programming languages, especially program synthesis.

I received my B.S. degree in computer science from Turing Class, [Peking University](https://pku.edu.cn). I used to be a member of [PKU-PLL](https://pl.cs.pku.edu.cn/), supervised by [Prof. Yingfei Xiong](https://xiongyingfei.github.io/). I also worked closely with [Prof. Di Wang](https://stonebuddha.github.io/).

Here is my [daily blog](http://dofy.top).
